&lt;p>why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;intracavernosal injection of phentolamine (an Î±-adrenergic antagonist) temporarily resolves the hard flaccid state and induces penile erection.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p>why is this significant?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is the primary neurotransmitter released by the sympathetic nervous system. norepinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors, as they are designed to allow norepinephrine to exert its effects on target cells in various tissues and organs of the body. norepinephrine cannot work without binding to adrenergic receptors, as its physiological effects are entirely dependent on interacting with them on target cells. think of it this way: sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine -&amp;gt; norepinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors -&amp;gt; norepinephrine tells adrenergic receptors what to do -&amp;gt; adrenergic receptors carry out function via targeted cells of whichever structure, organ, tissue etc. of the body.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
