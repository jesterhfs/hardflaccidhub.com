 why?

"intracavernosal injection of phentolamine (an α-adrenergic antagonist) temporarily resolves the hard flaccid state and induces penile erection." https://auanews.net/issues/articles/2023/may-2023/hard-flaccid-syndrome-proposed-to-be-secondary-to-pathological-activation-of-a-pelvic/pudendal-hypogastric-reflex

why is this significant?

norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is the primary neurotransmitter released by the sympathetic nervous system. norepinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors, as they are designed to allow norepinephrine to exert its effects on target cells in various tissues and organs of the body. norepinephrine cannot work without binding to adrenergic receptors, as its physiological effects are entirely dependent on interacting with them on target cells. think of it this way: sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine -> norepinephrine binds to adrenergic receptors -> norepinephrine tells adrenergic receptors what to do -> adrenergic receptors carry out function via targeted cells of whichever structure, organ, tissue etc. of the body.

there are two different kinds of adrenergic receptors: alpha, and beta. beta adrenergic receptors are mostly found in the heart, lungs, blood vessels, liver, and adipose tissue; alpha adrenergic receptors are mainly in blood vessels, smooth muscle, presynaptic nerve terminals, and the pancreas.

there are two sub-types of alpha adrenergic receptors: alpha 1, and alpha 2. alpha 1 adrenergic receptors mediate excitatory (stimulate) effects, and act directly on tissues to execute sympathetic responses via norepinephrine release such as vasoconstriction, pupil dilation, and smooth muscle contraction; alpha 2 adrenergic receptors mediate inhibitory effects (mainly presynaptically), and help regulate the activity of norepinephrine release. so basically, alpha 1 is pro-sympathetic, as it increases norepinephrine release and stimulates sympathetic functions; alpha 2 is anti-sympathetic, as it decreases norepinephrine release and inhibits sympathetic functions.

alpha-adrenergic antagonists (also called alpha blockers) like phentolamine are medications that block the effects of norepinephrine on alpha-adrenergic receptors. this inhibition relaxes smooth muscle, and dilates blood vessels. common conditions where alpha blockers are used as treatment: high blood pressure, benign prostatic hyperplasia, raynaud’s phenomenon.

smooth muscle tissue, which is found in the walls of internal organs like the stomach and intestines, is controlled by the autonomic (controls involuntary functions of the body, and includes the sympathetic nervous system) nervous system; skeletal muscle tissue, like your biceps and triceps, is controlled by the somatic (controls voluntary functions of the body, such as raising your arm) nervous system. the penis, like the bladder and stomach, is made up of smooth muscle tissue, therefore it is primarily controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for involuntary bodily functions; the somatic nervous system, via the pudendal nerve, does carry sensory information (touch, temperature, pleasure, etc.) from the penis to the brain, however, and also innervates the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles, which are responsible for the rhythmic contractions during ejaculation. the musculature of the pelvic floor, which is skeletal muscle, is also controlled by the somatic nervous system.

the detumescence of the penis, or the process of losing an erection, happens when the erectile smooth muscle tissue contracts (sympathetic response, btw) to let the blood out, and returns the penis to its flaccid state.

now that we have a basic understanding of the mechanisms at play here, let’s review the findings from the 2023 AUA article:

"intracavernosal injection of phentolamine (an α-adrenergic antagonist) temporarily resolves the hard flaccid state and induces penile erection." https://auanews.net/issues/articles/2023/may-2023/hard-flaccid-syndrome-proposed-to-be-secondary-to-pathological-activation-of-a-pelvic/pudendal-hypogastric-reflex

an injection of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that blocks the effects of norepinephrine which is the neurotransmitter released by the sympathetic nervous system, directly into the penis (intracavernous injections are injections into the base of the penis) temporarily RESOLVES--I'll repeat this, as it's very important: RESOLVES the "hard flaccid" state of the penis.

what can we infer from this?

we can infer that hard flaccid syndrome is very likely the result of excess sympathetic activity, or an excessive release of norepinephrine, in the erectile smooth muscle tissue of the penis. we can also infer that norepinephrine plays a role in mediating the flaccid state of the penis and inhibiting penile erection, as the injection of phentolamine also induced an erection.

now, how does this all relate to pelvic floor dysfunction, or musculoskeletal imbalances, or hypertonic pelvic floor, or whatever else?

the idea that pelvic floor dysfunction would cause the pathological autonomic nervous system dysfunction that is clearly occurring in hfs--as I tried my best to describe above--is not only baseless, but utterly ridiculous.
